<br/><br/><br/><br/>Green Tara: The Mother of Liberation<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
</div>
See [Ohgee](https://www.github.com/raygeeknyc/ohgee) for a favorite project of mine that was tied to Google Cloud - that worked well but proved untenable for two reasons:
1) Cloud is [too] expensive for an interactive project if you do not work for Google
2) GCP security doesn't support "config and forget" devices of this nature and I regularly have to update or change my authorization logic to keep it online

Well... in the 5+ years since I wrote Ohgee, the Edge computing landscape has changed: New machines and new software make it feasible to provide the speech, language and image services I performed in the cloud on device now.

Thus... Project Green Tara - who liberates us from the Cloud!

I also think that it's time for an animatronic head to replace Ohgee's cute cartoon robot head
(that to come)
